<h2>Meaning behind it</h2>
<p>The word Carol means dance of praise and joy.
    Carols used to be written during all four seasons,
    but only the tradition of singing them at Christmas has really survived.</p>

<h2>Special Announcement</h2>
<p><i>"And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby,
keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them,
and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will
cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord." (Luke 2:8-11)</i></p>
<p>When something of deep importance happens there is great excitement. The news here is that someone very special has been born,
    this is no ordinary child but he will be a cause of great joy. This joy has found it's expression in the lyrics of multitudes of Christmas carols.</p>
