<h2>Phone an old friend</h2>

<p>It's not always easy to keep up with distant friends. Facebook and Twitter can be fun, but
    there's nothing like a good chat. I'm sure you have already thought of someone 
    that you'd like to speak to, or you feel a bit bad for ignoring for a while.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tell us how it went. We're they please you called?</li>
    <li>Was it awkward, or did you pick up from where you left off?</li>
</ul>
<p>Hit us up with the <a class="tweet">#AdventHunt6 #submit</a> hashtags</p>
